## Known issues

- Currently it does not account for players (including yourself) joining or leaving the FC.
- Matching players is done based on Lodestone data, since FC tags are not necessarily unique. Because of this there is not a 100% guarantee it will be accurate when players leave/join or change their names.
- Nameplates do not immediately update when changing colours or disabling/enabling the nameplate colouring options. This is a technical limitation of the method used to override the character nameplates, if someone finds a better way let me know!
